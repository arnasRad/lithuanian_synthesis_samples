# Lithuanian Speech Synthesis Samples

Samples of Lithuanian speech synthesis generated by neural network systems. Results from master thesis work "Lithuanian
Speech Synthesis Using Neural Networks" by Arnas Radzeviƒçius.

Samples were synthesized by two neural networks models ([Tacotron 2](https://github.com/NVIDIA/tacotron2) and [VITS](https://github.com/jaywalnut310/vits)) trained on the following Lithuanian language datasets: Vytautas (92-hour), Paulius (10-hour), and Aurimas (6-hour). Tacotron 2 was trained on Vytautas and Aurimas datasets, while VITS was trained on Vytautas and Paulius datasets. Ground-truth examples are also provided in the samples.
